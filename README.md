## Introduction
This is an implementation of reinforcement learning algorithm consists of Q-learning and Sarsa. Their differents exist in whether take policy into consideration while learning. The environment is a maze and the task for agents is to learn how to make the best decision for action. The learning process is completed when the actions converge.
The difference between reinforcement learning and MDP is that reinforcement learning is a model free algorithm which do not require much background information from the environment.

## how to run:
call python play.py 1 to see the demonstration call python tester.py and read the detailed instruction.

Note: It may take several minutes to finish the learning process.
